There are two ways we can have interaction between the components.
Not Clean Way:
		•	Define a textpanel in toolbar and link this to the customTextPanel.
		•	Now implement the actionPerformed in the component customToolbar.
		•	Issue: Things are very tightly coupled. Toolbar knows about the textpanel.
		
Clean Way:
		•	Define an interface and have the toolbar have a member of this interface.
		•	Now when we define a component toolbar in our main controller we can implement the method of inteface
			at the object toolbar level.
		•	This avoids the need for toolbar to know about the textPanel.
